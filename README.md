CDFLabs
=======

CDF Labs is a simple and lightweight app that allows Computer Science students at University of Toronto St George to quickly check how many machines are available in the various CDF computer labs in Bahen, Gerstein, and on NX.

This app uses data provided by the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science Computing Disciplines Faculty (CDF) at [http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/usage/](http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/usage/).

This project was created using Android Studio (*not Eclipse*).
The older version (`/old/`) was created in Android Studio Preview, and the newer version (with rough support for Android L, `/new`) was created in Android Studio Beta, so they have slightly different structures. Also note that the newer beta version is aimed at the Android L developer preview and as such is incompatible with older versions of Android (due to the nature of the preview SDK).

The app is available for download from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.echeung.cdflabs).
