CDF Labs is a simple and lightweight Android app (requires Android 4.1+) that allows Computer Science students at University of Toronto St George to quickly check the availability of CDF computers and the printer queues.

This app fetches data from the following sources:
- Computer usage data from <http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/usage/usage.html>, provided by the Computing Disciplines Facility (CDF)
- Printer queue data from a [JSON file](http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~g3cheunh/cdfprinters.json) generated using [cdf-printdata](https://github.com/arkon/cdf-printdata)
