CDF Labs is a simple and lightweight Android app (requires Android 4.1+) that allows Computer Science students at University of Toronto St George to quickly check how many machines are available in the various CDF computer labs in Bahen and on NX.

This app fetches data from the following sources:
- Computer usage data from <http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/usage/usage.html>, provided by the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science Computing Disciplines Faculty (CDF)
- Printer queue data from a [JSON file](http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/~g3cheunh/printdata.json) generated using [cdf-printdata](https://github.com/arkon/cdf-printdata)
