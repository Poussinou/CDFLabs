CDF Labs is a simple and lightweight app that allows Computer Science students at University of Toronto St George to quickly check how many machines are available in the various CDF computer labs in Bahen and on NX.

This app uses data provided by the University of Toronto Department of Computer Science Computing Disciplines Faculty (CDF) at [http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/usage/](http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/usage/).

This project was created using Android Studio Beta (*not Eclipse*).

This app is available under a GPL V2 license, so you're free to redistrubute the code however you wish, but you must make your code available under the same terms.
